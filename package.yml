summary    : python-sip is a tool that creates python bindings for C and C++ libraries.
description: |
    SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes so that they can be
    accessed as normal Python classes. SIP takes many of its ideas from SWIG but,
    because it is specifically designed for C++ and Python, is able to generate
    tighter bindings. SIP is so called because it is a small SWIG.
